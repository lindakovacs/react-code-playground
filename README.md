# Code playground

A component for rendering HTML, CSS, Javascript code
with editable source and live preview.

# What is this ?

This is a React component for generating code mockup.
You can think of this like CodePen or JSFiddle of you own.

## How is this different from [component-playground](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/component-playground)

## Can I use this on a site doesn't use React ?

Sorry but I don't have plan for this at the momment.

You can use some standalone alternative solution like
[jotted](https://github.com/ghinda/jotted) or
[editr.js](https://github.com/Idered/Editr.js).
In facts, Code playground was inspired by those projects
